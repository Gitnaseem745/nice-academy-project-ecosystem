# Shared Ecosystem Resources

This directory contains the central **"operating system"** for the Nice Academy project ecosystem. It houses the mandatory guidelines and templates that ensure every student project meets professional industry standards.

## 📂 Directory Layout

*   **`guidelines/`** → **The Rules.** Immutable standards for code, commits, language, and behavior.
*   **`templates/`** → **The Starting Points.** Standardized files to copy into new projects and documented workflows.

## 🔝 Criticality Analysis (Priority Order)

| Priority | File | Role | Why it is Critical for Students |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P0** | `guidelines/learn-in-public-rules.md` | **Philosophy** | Shifts mindset from "studying" to "building a career". Prevents "tutorial hell" by forcing public output. |
| **P0** | `templates/learn-in-public-workflow.md` | **Process** | The actionable checklist for P0. Without this, students will skip the most high-value career activity (sharing). |
| **P1** | `guidelines/documentation-standards.md` | **Quality** | Teaches communication—the #1 soft skill for devs. Ensures projects are "resume-ready" and not just code dumps. |
| **P1** | `templates/project-intent.md` | **Focus** | Forces students to define "Why am I doing this?" before writing code. Prevents aimless coding. |
| **P2** | `guidelines/commit-message-guide.md` | **Discipline** | Instills industry-standard git hygiene. Bad commits are a red flag for recruiters; this fixes that early. |
| **P2** | `templates/reflection.md` | **Growth** | Converts "doing" into "learning". Ensures students internalize lessons rather than just rushing to finish. |
| **P3** | `guidelines/language-policy.md` | **Scale** | Essential for the system's growth (English/Hinglish). Ensures quality control across languages. |
| **P3** | `guidelines/mermaid-usage.md` | **Visuals** | Critical for "self-navigable" documentation. Reduces the need for video explanations. |
| **P3** | `templates/README.md` | **Standard** | Reduces friction when starting. Ensures every project looks professional by default. |
