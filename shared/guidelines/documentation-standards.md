# Documentation Standards

This ecosystem treats **documentation as part of the work**, not an afterthought.

Every project must be understandable by a stranger without verbal explanation.

---

## Required Documentation Files

Each project must include:

- README.md
- project-intent.md
- guide/ (English + Hinglish)
- reflection.md

---

## Writing Principles

All documentation must be:

- Clear
- Structured
- Instructional
- Constraint-aware
- Mentor-style (not tutorial-style)

Avoid:
- Marketing language
- Motivational fluff
- Over-explaining basics

---

## Guide Writing Rules

Guides must:

- Explain *what to do*
- Explain *why it matters*
- Explain *what not to do*
- Explain *when to stop*

Guides must NOT:

- Contain full code
- Contain copy-paste snippets
- Reference solution files directly

---

## README Rules

README.md must always answer:

1. What is this project?
2. Who is it for?
3. How should it be learned?
4. When should the solution be used?

Mermaid diagrams must be included where flow exists.

## Tone & Style

- Professional
- Calm
- Direct
- No slang
- No emojis

Think like a mentor, not a YouTuber.

## Why This Exists

Good documentation:
- Reduces confusion
- Improves learning quality
- Builds communication skills
- Scales teaching without repetition
