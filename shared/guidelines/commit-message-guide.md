# Commit Message Guide

This document defines the **mandatory commit message standards** for the
Nice Academy Learning Ecosystem.

Clear commits are required to:
- Track learning progress
- Maintain professionalism
- Make student work reviewable
- Reflect real-world engineering discipline

---

## Commit Message Format

Use the following structure:

<action>: <short, clear description>

### Examples
- add: initial layout structure
- update: improve spacing and typography
- fix: resolve navbar responsiveness issue
- docs: clarify guide execution steps
- refactor: simplify JavaScript logic

---

## Allowed Action Keywords

- add — introducing new files or features
- update — improving existing content
- fix — correcting bugs or mistakes
- refactor — improving structure without changing behavior
- docs — documentation-only changes
- remove — deleting unused code or files

---

## Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- ❌ No vague messages like `final`, `done`, `update`
- ❌ No multiple changes in one commit without explanation
- ❌ No emojis
- ❌ No capitalized sentences

- ✅ One logical change per commit
- ✅ Present tense only
- ✅ Short and descriptive

---

## Why This Matters

Your GitHub commit history is part of your **resume signal**.

Recruiters and mentors look for:
- Thoughtful progress
- Clean iteration
- Professional habits

Bad commits = weak signal  
Clean commits = trust
