# Learn in Public Rules

Learning in public is a **discipline**, not a marketing tactic.

This document defines how students must build, document, and share their work.

---

## Core Principle

> Build privately, **document publicly**.

You are not teaching.
You are **showing your process**.

---

## Mandatory Sharing Stages

Each project must include:

1. Start announcement
2. Progress updates
3. Final launch post

Skipping any stage breaks the learning loop.

---

## Approved Platforms

Depending on role:

- LinkedIn (mandatory for all)
- GitHub (developers / documentation)
- Twitter / X (optional micro-updates)
- Dribbble / Behance (designers)
- Portfolio website (final destination)

---

## What to Share

- What you are building
- What you learned
- What challenged you
- What you improved

---

## What NOT to Share

- Full tutorials
- Solution code
- Pretending expertise
- Daily noise posts

---

## Final Rule

If a project is not shared publicly,
it is considered **incomplete**.

Learning compounds only when visible.
