# Language Policy

This ecosystem supports **multiple languages** while maintaining
a **single source of truth**.

---

## Canonical Language

English (`en`) is the **canonical language**.

All guides must be:
1. Written first in English
2. Reviewed for clarity
3. Then adapted to other languages

---

## Supported Languages

Currently supported:

- English → `guide/en/`
- Hinglish (Hindi + English) → `guide/hi-en/`

Future languages may be added using the same structure.

---

## Structural Rules (Strict)

- File names must match exactly across languages
- File order must match exactly
- Steps must match exactly
- No extra steps in translated guides

---

## Content Rules for Hinglish

Hinglish guides may:
- Be more conversational
- Use cultural clarity
- Simplify explanations slightly

Hinglish guides must NOT:
- Add new concepts
- Change learning flow
- Skip constraints

---

## Update Workflow

1. Update English guide
2. Commit changes
3. Update Hinglish guide
4. Commit separately

Never update Hinglish first.

---

## Why This Policy Exists

This ensures:
- Consistency
- Maintainability
- Predictable learning experience
- Easier scaling
