# ⚠️ Solution Reference

**STOP!**

This folder contains the *finished* code for the project.

## How to use this folder:
1.  **Do NOT copy-paste** files from here. It defeats the purpose of learning.
2.  **Only** look here if you are completely stuck and the guide didn't help.
3.  If you do look, read the code, understand it, then **close the file** and type it yourself.

## Features implemented:
- Semantic HTML structure.
- Responsive design using CSS Flexbox and Grid.
