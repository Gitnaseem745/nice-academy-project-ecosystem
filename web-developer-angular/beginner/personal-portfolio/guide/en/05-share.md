You built it. Now ship it.

## 🚀 Deployment (GitHub Pages)
This is the easiest way to host a static site for free.

1.  **Push to GitHub**: Make sure your code is in a repository on GitHub.
2.  **Settings**: Go to your Repo -> Settings -> Pages.
3.  **Source**: Select "Deploy from a branch".
4.  **Branch**: Select `main` (or `master`) and `/root` folder.
5.  **Save**: Wait a minute, and you will get a live URL!

## 📢 Promote It
1.  **LinkedIn**: Post a screenshot and your link. "Just built my first portfolio from scratch!"
2.  **Resume**: Add this link to your PDF resume.
3.  **Nice Academy**: Share it in the community discord if you are part of one.

## 🔄 What's Next?
- Add a "Dark Mode" toggle.
- Add simple animations (fade in on scroll).
- Add a contact form (using a service like Formspree).

**Congratulations on becoming a Web Developer!** 🎉
