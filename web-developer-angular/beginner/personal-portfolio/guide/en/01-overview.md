# 01. Overview

## 👋 Welcome
You are about to build your digital home. A **Personal Portfolio** is more than just code; it's your resume, your gallery, and your handshake to the world.

## 🎯 The Goal
Build a single-page website that includes:
- **Hero Section**: An introduction to who you are.
- **About Me**: A brief bio.
- **Projects**: A showcase of your work (even if it's just this project!).
- **Skills**: A visual list of what you know.
- **Contact**: A way for people to reach you (email, social links).

## 🛠 Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you are comfortable with:
- Creating HTML files and linking CSS/JS.
- Basic CSS styling (padding, margin, colors).
- The idea of a "Box Model".

## 📦 What You Will Build
We will focus on a **Clean, Light Theme**.
- **Layout**: Responsive (works on mobile and desktop).
- **Navigation**: Sticky header with links that scroll to sections.
- **Interactivity**: Smooth scrolling and a mobile hamburger menu.

## 🧘 Mindset
Do not rush. This is not about finishing fast; it's about understanding *why* you are writing every line of code.
