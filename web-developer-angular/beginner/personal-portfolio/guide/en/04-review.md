Stop coding. Switch to "User Mode".

## 🔍 Visual Check
1.  **Resizing**: Drag your browser window from very wide to very narrow. Does anything break? Do scrollbars appear horizontally (they shouldn't)?
2.  **Text**: Is the text readable? Is the contrast between text and background high enough?
3.  **Spacing**: Do sections feel cramped? White space is your friend. Add more padding if needed.

## 🧪 Functionality Check
1.  **Links**: Click every single link in your navigation. Do they go to the right section?
2.  **Console**: Open Developer Tools (F12) -> Console. Are there any red errors?
3.  **Mobile Menu**: Open it, click a link. Does it close automatically? (Bonus points if you implemented that!).

## 🧹 Code Quality
1.  **Indentation**: Is your HTML/CSS properly indented?
2.  **Comments**: Did you leave any detailed comments explaining *complex* parts (not obvious parts)?
3.  **Unused Code**: Delete any commented-out code blocks you are not using.

## 🏆 The "Mom Test"
Show it to someone non-technical (like your mom or a friend).
- Do they understand what the site is about in 5 seconds?
- Can they find your contact info?
