# Project Intent: Personal Portfolio

## 🎯 Who is this for?
This project is designed for **Beginner Web Developers** who have a basic understanding of:
- **HTML5**: semantic tags, structure.
- **CSS3**: selectors, box model, flexbox/grid, responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: variables, functions, basic DOM manipulation.

It is perfect for students transitioning from "learning syntax" to "building real things."

## 🏆 What Skills Does This Prove?
Completing this project demonstrates that you can:
1.  **Structure a Valid Web Project**: separating concerns (HTML, CSS, JS).
2.  **Build Responsive Layouts**: using modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid) for mobile and desktop.
3.  **Implement Semantic HTML**: for accessibility and SEO.
4.  **Write Clean JavaScript**: for enhancing user experience (interactions) without frameworks.
5.  **Design Professionally**: creating a clean, light-themed, modern UI.
6.  **Deploy**: (Implicit) You have a static site ready for GitHub Pages or Netlify.

## 🤔 Why Benchmark at Beginner Level?
A personal portfolio is the quintessential beginner project because:
- **Identity**: It gives you a place to showcase future work.
- **Scope**: It touches every core web technology without needing a backend or database.
- **Flexibility**: It allows for creativity while adhering to strict structural rules.
- **Foundation**: It reinforces the "Holy Trinity" of the web (HTML/CSS/JS) before introducing frameworks like Angular or React.

## 🚫 What This is NOT
- It is NOT a lesson on frameworks (No React, Angular, Vue).
- It is NOT a design course (we provide the constraints).
- It is NOT a copy-paste exercise.

Your goal is to build something you are proud to show a potential employer.
