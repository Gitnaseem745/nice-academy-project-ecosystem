# 🧠 Reflection

After completing your portfolio, take a moment to answer these questions honestly. This self-review will help solidify your learning.

## HTML & Structure
1.  Did you use semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` instead of just `<div>`? Why is this important?
2.  Are your `alt` attributes descriptive for all images?

## CSS & Design
1.  How did you make the layout responsive? Did you use Media Queries, Flexbox, or Grid? Which one did you find most useful?
2.  Is your code "DRY" (Don't Repeat Yourself)? Did you use CSS variables (custom properties) for colors and fonts?
3.  Does the site look good on a mobile phone?

## JavaScript
1.  What specific problem did JavaScript solve in your portfolio (e.g., mobile menu, theme toggle)?
2.  Could any of your JS functionality have been achieved with CSS only?

## General
1.  What was the hardest part of this project?
2.  If you had to start over, what would you do differently?
3.  On a scale of 1-10, how "production-ready" is your code?
